# Approach
My approach was a landing page with a basic nav, a hero element, footer, and three main sections: the sale countdown, product carousel, and email subscription form.

My countdown ticker uses vanilla JavaScript to get the user's current time and calculate days and hours until the sale date/time.

For the product carousel, I decided to create a flex container that you can either scroll through or use the arrow buttons. It is responsive; the number of slides visible is controlled through css. I also added subtle animation for when the user hovers over a slide.

Although many style guidelines were provided, I did play around with the styling to account for a more responsive page, primarily with font sizing.
